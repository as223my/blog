###Hello World!

I have finally publish my two examples of hello world on my githubpage. 
In the first example i followed facebooks guide to react.

I found the example a bit hard to follow, mostly because
the lack of information. For exampel, i didn't even know where to stop in the 
tutorial and what to do with the main.js file in the beginning. 

Thanks to mia (mn22nw) i also found out about a boilerplate (https://github.com/gaearon/react-transform-boilerplate)
which was very handy to use (except a problem with build, added set and &&).
