# First week - a lot of confusing moments. 

### Hi again!

Oh boy! Where should I begin? I'm feeling so rusty in my skills right now, or at least I did in the beginning of the week. 
Now it feels a little bit better after spending some time refreshing my javascript memory. 
I have also join the guild and read a bit in the slack channel to keep up with any news (fun tweet from Dan Abramov btw). <br>

I took a sneak peak on redux and react and I was VERY confused. I'm hoping that after the next week the concept has become less foggy, atleast for a little little bit ;).
