# Presentation

### Hi!

My name is Annie and I live a few miles outside of gothenburg. 
I'm from WP13, and I'm spending this year to complement a few coursers that i have missed and I also recently bought a little puppy which takes up alot of my spare time. 

I have more experience in backend programming than frontend, thats also the reason why I want to take part of this course.
I'm hoping to better my javascript and have fun along the way.
